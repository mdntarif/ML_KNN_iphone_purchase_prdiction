# iPhone Purchase Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will purchase an iPhone based on their data using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model is built using the dataset `iphone_purchase_records.csv` and implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on customer demographics and their iPhone purchase behavior.

## Steps

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Apply the KNN algorithm for prediction.
5. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells to train and evaluate the model.

## Conclusion

The KNN algorithm is used to predict iPhone purchases based on customer features, with performance evaluation based on accuracy.
